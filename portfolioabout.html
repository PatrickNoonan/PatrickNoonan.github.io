            <p>Hi :) my name is Patrick and I'm currently pursuing a career as a software developer. For the past 5
                years or so I've been working in the tech industry on the hardware side of things, mainly fixing
                computers, but also with other electronics like cell phones, speakers, and headsets.
                <br>
                I enjoy working with technologies of all kinds. I specifically love the idea of being able to
                think of a new concept and build it from
                scratch, something I believe is much easier for one person to accomplish on the software side of things.
            </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="aboutElements col-sm-9">
            <p>My interests include traveling, trying new foods, meeting new people, football, basketball, boxing, and
                MMA.  I don't actually have any interests in cats but they seem to make pretty good placeholders.
                <br>

                In my free time I like to spend time with family, run, lift things up and put them down, read, play pc
                games,
                watch twitch, youtube videos about space and animals, rewatch Rick and Morty, and attempt to
                binge watch something popular on Netflix but quitting before I get past the second episode.
